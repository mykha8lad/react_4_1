                            <p><span style={{fontWeight: 600}}>“The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark”</span> ( eng.  The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark ) or briefly <span style={{fontWeight: 600}}>“Hamlet, Prince of Denmark”</span> or <span style={{fontWeight: 600}}>“Hamlet”</span>  is a tragedy by William Shakespeare in five acts, one of his most famous plays and one of the most famous plays in world drama [1] . Written in 1599-1601. It is Shakespeare's longest play, with 4,042 lines and 29,551 words. The setting of the play  is Denmark , where Prince Hamlet takes revenge on his uncle Claudius for the murder of his father , committed in order to take the throne and marry Hamlet's mother Gertrude .</p>
                            <p>The tragedy is included in the World Library (a list of the most significant works of world literature by the Norwegian Book Club , compiled from a survey of 100 critics and writers from around the world). Tragedy was one of Shakespeare's most popular works during his lifetime and remains so to this day. It is considered one of the most filmed stories after the fairy tale “ Cinderella ”.</p>
                            <p>The history of Shakespeare's Hamlet goes back to the ancient legend of Amled from the chronicle " The Acts of the Danes " by Saxo Grammar of the 13th century, retold in the 16th century. French scientist Francois de Belfort . Shakespeare may also have been the author of the earlier Elizabethan play, now known as Ur-Hamlet , later rewriting it into a modern version. He almost certainly wrote a new version of the title role for his fellow actor Richard Burbage ; Shakespeare himself played the shadow of Hamlet's father. The first production took place at the Globe Theater (London). Over 400 years on stage, the role of Hamlet was performed by many outstanding actors of his time.</p>
                            <p>Three different early versions of the play have survived to this day: First Quarto (Q1, 1603), Second Quarto (Q2, 1604), First Infolio (F1, 1623). Each version contains stanzas and even entire scenes that are missing in the others. The structure of the play and the depth of its characters have been the subject of numerous critical studies, such as the centuries-old debate about Hamlet's hesitation before killing his uncle, which some see as simply a plot driver and others as a dramatization of the complex philosophical and ethical issues surrounding cold-blooded murder, deliberate revenge and fading of desire.</p>
                            <p>The main character of the play is the Danish prince Hamlet , about 30 years old, the son of the recently deceased King Hamlet and the nephew of his brother, King Claudius, who inherited the throne . Denmark has a long-standing feud with neighboring Norway , during which King Hamlet killed the Norwegian king Fortinbras on the battlefield several years ago. Although Denmark ultimately defeated Norway and the Norwegian throne went to King Fortinbras's sickly brother, the Danes worry that an attack by the Norwegians, led by their late king's son, Prince Fortinbras , is imminent.</p>
                            <p>On the ramparts surrounding Elsinore , the royal palace of the Danish monarchs, the officers of the night watch, Bernardo and Marcellus, several times see a ghost that bears a striking resemblance to the recently deceased king, and call Horatio , a friend of Prince Hamlet, as a witness. When the ghost appears again, all three decide to report what they saw to Prince Hamlet.</p>
                            <p>The next day at court, as King Claudius and Queen Gertrude discuss matters of state with their senior advisor Polonius , Hamlet appears sullen. At the meeting, Claudius grants Polonius' son Laertes the right to return to study in France and sends envoys to report concerns about Fortinbras to the King of Norway. Claudius reproaches Hamlet for prolonged mourning for his father and forbids him to return to study in Wittenberg. Privately after the meeting, Hamlet despairs over the death of his father and the hasty remarriage of his mother. Having learned about the ghost from Horatio, he decides to see it himself.</p>
                            <p>Polonius advises his son Laertes, who is going to France, to “be true to yourself.” Polonius's daughter Ophelia admits that she is interested in Hamlet, but Laertes warns her to seek the attention of the prince, and Polonius orders her to refuse all his advances. That same night on the rampart, a meeting with a ghost leads the prince into horror and complete confusion - the ghost told him that he was poisoned by his brother Claudius, the current king, who poured poison into his ear while he was sleeping. Hamlet's father's shadow bequeaths revenge to his son. He agrees, and the ghost disappears. Having taken the word of silence from Horatio and the guard officers, Hamlet tells them that he will pretend to be mad in order to obtain irrefutable evidence of Claudius’ guilt. Thus, the prince still has some doubts about the veracity of the ghost.</p>
